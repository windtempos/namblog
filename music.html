   <p>I first heard of ericdoa with the ninja low taper fade meme.</p>
   <p>My sister thought he was Viet because she thought his name was Eric Dao.</p>
   <p>Saw him live when he opened for Porter Robinsion during the Smile World Tour.</p>
   <p>His music kinda sounds like Odetari with Porter angst.</p>
